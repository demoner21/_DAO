To test the contract on the testnet, you will also need to have the Tirdweb library and the Truffle Framework installed.

    Install Tirdweb: npm install tirdweb
    Install Truffle: npm install -g truffle
    Compile the contract: truffle compile
    Deploy the contract to the testnet: truffle migrate --network rinkeby
    Interact with the contract using Tirdweb and Truffle's console.

Please note that the smart contract has not been audited and it is for educational purpose.
Additional Information

    You may have to configure the truffle-config.js and the environment variables to connect to the OpenSea testnet.
    Make sure you have enough test ether in your wallet to deploy and interact with the smart contract on the OpenSea testnet.
    You can use the Rinkeby testnet to test the smart contract.

Please note that the smart contract has not been audited and it is for educational purpose.
